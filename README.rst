Requirements
============
- ``Docker``: `Installation steps for Docker in Ubuntu/Debian <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#os-requirements>`_
- ``Ansible``: `Installation steps for Ansible <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html>`_
- ``ssh-keygen``: Generate a RSA Key Pair for the user who will install the script.
- ``passlib``: Install ``python-pip`` package in ubuntu and then do ``pip install passlib``.

Release
=======

ideam v1.0.0_

Use the ideam deb file to install in Linux machines after satisfying the requirements. ``dpkg -i ideam.deb`` .


.. _v1.0.0: https://github.com/rbccps-iisc/ideam/releases/latest

Configuration
=============

ideam.conf_ v1.0.0

- Config file is located at ``/etc/ideam/ideam.conf``.

- The data files or docker persistent storage is at ``/var/ideam/data`` directory.

- The persistent storage can be changed by modifying the ``ideam.conf`` before installation.

.. _ideam.conf: https://github.com/rbccps-iisc/ideam/blob/master/ideam.conf


Steps to Install
================

After downloading and installing the deb file, do the following steps.

+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Installation                          | ``ideam install``   or if you cloned ``./ideam install``                    |
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Start Ideam                           | ``ideam start``    or if you cloned ``./ideam start``                       |
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Serving Ideam at                      | ``https://localhost:10443``                                                 |
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


- The application will be serving with a self-signed certificate.
  If you want to use your certificate, have your .crt and .key file as ``/usr/share/ideam/config/kong/default_443.crt`` and
  ``/usr/share/ideam/config/kong/default_443.key`` respectively and do a fresh installation.

- If you want to delete all the data stored as part of ideam, ``ideam rmdata``.

- If you want to test all API endpoints of ideam, ``ideam test``.

- If installation fails at some instance, all the time-dated logs are available at ``/tmp/ideam-%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M.log``.

Customising the install
============================

If you want to install IDEAM for contributing to the project (or if you just want to customise the installation) then do the following:

- ``git clone https://github.com/rbccps-iisc/ideam.git && cd ideam``
- Make sure you have all the dependencies installed (as mentioned previously)
- Run ``python ideam.py install -f ideam.conf``
- If you want to install only some of the containers (maybe because some succeeded and some failed) you can install it by typing

  ``python ideam.py install -f ideam.conf -l <comma separated list of containers>``
  
  For e.g ``python ideam.py install -f ideam.conf -l kong,rabbitmq,tomcat``

- Once the installation completes, the containers need to be started by using

  ``python ideam.py start``

- If only some of the containers need to be started then use

  ``python ideam.py start -l <comma separated list of containers>``
  
  For e.g. ``python ideam.py start -l pushpin,hypercat``
  
Using the quick install option
==============================

All the docker images have been pre-built with the dependencies and the respective configuration files in the `IDEAM docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/ideam/>`_. Furthermore, these docker images use alpine as their base image, thereby being significantly smaller in size. To use this option in your IDEAM installation use:

``python ideam.py install -f ideam.conf --quick``

After the process completes, the middleware should be up and running. There is no need to run the start command.   
  
A note on security
==================

The IDEAM stack has certain security mechanisms put in place that can be enabled by using

``python ideam.py start --with-idps``

IDPS stands for intrusion detection and prevention system. A system that is meant to protect the stack against common security attacks like DoS, DDoS, brute force and so on. A detailed document on security of the IDEAM stack can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yWzBSVf0yk_Y7alYG9Iu7Vgqi0NKPUvverJdGELWaUg/edit?usp=sharing>`_

Common problems
===============
- Installation in Linux machines can fail for the following reasons.
    - If you are in a corporate network that blocks Google DNS Servers, the ``ideam install`` command fails.

      To fix it, add your corporate DNS servers in DOCKER_OPTS in /etc/default/docker. (for SysV machines)

         DOCKER_OPTS="--dns 208.67.222.222 --dns 208.67.220.220"

      If this fails to set the DNS properly, try updating /etc/docker/daemon.json with the following (for systemd machines)

         { "dns": ["208.67.222.222", "208.67.220.220"] }
       
- If copying the RegisterAPI.war fails, then run

  ``chown -R $(whoami) /var/ideam``
  
- If there is an error because of SSH keys then run

  ``ssh-keygen -t rsa``

- IDEAM has been tested on MacOS as well. However, the elasticsearch container might fail because of the ``vm.max_map_count`` setting. If this happens then try increasing the swap space of the docker VM
